# eShopOnWeb-main

The eShopOnWeb repository has been updated and moved to https://github.com/dotnet/eShop. Active development will continue there. For building web apps with enterprise app patterns, you can refer to the Reliable Web App patterns guidance.

This reference application, powered by Microsoft, showcases a monolithic application architecture and deployment model. If you're new to .NET development, you can find guidance in the Getting Started for Beginners guide.

To learn more about this reference application, you can watch a live stream providing an overview by Steve "ardalis" 

The reference application is related to the eShopOnContainers sample application, which focuses on a microservices/containers-based application architecture. In contrast, eShopOnWeb is simpler, focusing on traditional Web Application Development with a single deployment approach.

The main branch is currently running ASP.NET Core 8.0, with older versions tagged for reference. The application is meant to demonstrate principles and patterns described in the Architecting Modern Web Applications with ASP.NET Core and Azure ebook, updated to ASP.NET Core 8.0. You can also read the book in online format here.

The sample can be run using the Azure Developer CLI (azd). You can follow the instructions provided above for configuring and running the sample locally, using Docker, and in a dev container environment. Additionally, community extensions such as eShopOnWeb VB.NET and FShopOnWeb are available for further exploration.

Feel free to explore these resources to deepen your understanding of ASP.NET Core development and application architecture.
